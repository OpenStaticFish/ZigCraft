**Classification**: Feature Request (Optimization Task)

This is a well-structured optimization task. Key observations:

1. **Dependencies**: Correctly blocked by #211, #212, #213. Profiling requires all features implemented first.

2. **Implementation**: GPU timestamp queries will need additions to the RHI layer (rhi.zig, rhi_vulkan.zig) to wrap Vulkan timestamp queries around render passes.

3. **Conflict Risk**: Medium risk noted for presets.json. Rebasing after Phase 1 merges will be necessary.

4. **Testing**: `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` is appropriate for performance profiling.

**Recommended sequence**:
1. Ensure #211-213 are merged first
2. Add timing infrastructure to RHI
3. Profile across hardware tiers (integrated, mid-range, high-end)
4. Tune presets based on measured data

The proposed preset matrix provides reasonable starting values, but final tuning should use actual performance measurements per tier.
